![Design preview for the E-commerce product page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my implementation for this front-end coding challenge.
Please keep on reading if you are interested of my approach and structure.

## What assets are available?

The design layouts preview for desktop and mobile are available. The content assets for optimised images in jpg format are accesible as well .
Img formats for mobile thumbnails and jbg.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building the project

![User Stories, Features and Flow Chart](./User_Stories.png 'User Stories')

Building this small project I chose to write a short user storie and feature list, that could build up into a bigger application.

The project is written in SASS to have the best structured outcome for future progressions on the web app.
